# Vulnerability Scanner

This tool helps discover and exploit vulnerabilities in a target system.

## Roadmap

1. **Target Input**
   - User inputs the target IP address or hostname.

2. **Port Scanning**
   - The tool scans the target system for open ports using Nmap.
   - It displays the results in a tabular format, including the port number, service, and version.

3. **CVE Research**
   - The user chooses to search for CVEs on a specific port or on all open ports.
   - The tool searches for potential vulnerabilities associated with the open ports using an external database.

4. **Exploit Selection**
   - The user chooses an exploit related to the identified CVEs.
   - They can either use a custom exploit (by providing a Metasploit path) or a simple Hydra attack.

5. **Exploitation**
   - The tool launches the chosen exploit, allowing the user to interact with the target system accordingly.
